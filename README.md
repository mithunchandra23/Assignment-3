# Assignment-3

This repository contains Python scripts for two tasks: calculating the factorial of a number using a function and performing calculations using the math module.

## Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function

### Problem Statement:
Write a Python program that:
1. Defines a function named `factorial` that takes a number as an argument and calculates its factorial using a loop or recursion.
2. Returns the calculated factorial.
3. Calls the function with a sample number and prints the output.

### Features:
- Defines a function to calculate the factorial of a given number.
- Uses a loop or recursion to compute the factorial.
- Prints the calculated factorial when the function is called.


## Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations

### Problem Statement:
Write a Python program that:
1. Asks the user for a number as input.
2. Uses the math module to calculate the:
   - Square root of the number
   - Natural logarithm (log base e) of the number
   - Sine of the number (in radians)
3. Displays the calculated results.

### Features:
- Takes an input number from the user.
- Uses the `math` module to compute the square root, natural logarithm, and sine of the number.
- Displays the results of these calculations.
